   <p1>My name is Justin Snider. I am a Senior (I think) at Eastern Washington University. I'm working on my Bachelor of Arts degree in Visual Communication Design and hope to have that completed in about a year.</p1>
   
   <h1>About</h1>
   
   <hr>
   
   <p1>I've been drawing since I was really young and I would say that's the first thing that got me into design. I like being able to put together a collection of things I've made whether it's pencil drawings, computer designed posters, or websites (the latter still needs some work, as you can see). I'm a big fan of poster art for films, album art, and vintage sports logos. I hope to someday start a T-Shirt brand that commemorates historic moments and personalities in sports.</p1>
